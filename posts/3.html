    <div id="maincontent-forpost" style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;"><p>Hi, I&#39;m StuffzEZ, a developer who likes to learn all programming languages.. But my best programming languages are frontend ones like HTML, CSS, JS etc. And this is <strong>How <em>I</em> made a web browser as a frontend developer</strong>.</p>
<h2>The research</h2>
<p>I had the idea of making a web browser for a long time. I wanted a new kind of web browser. One that wasn&#39;t owned by a big tech giant or took up 16GB of RAM in the background so I originally thought of something I had used for one of my other projects (<a href="https://github.com/OptionallyBlueStudios/BlueHub">BlueHub</a>), Tauri. I had used it to port my web app into a desktop app and it worked great for BlueHub; Hardly <strong>ANY</strong> resources were used. So I thought of a name, created a new project, coded it....</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What? CORS error???</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, the way I programmed this was by putting the content eg. google.com in an IFrame. I couldn&#39;t do multiple webviews because Tauri didn&#39;t have them then. So I realised that this wasn&#39;t going to work and I just moved on.. Until one day...</p>
<h2>The Rediscovery</h2>
<p>It&#39;s Monday and I am looking through my repositories when I re-discover my forgotten browser and I wonder..</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <em>Is this possible now?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I look through every corner of the Tauri documentation then, by accident, I see a GitHub repository when I mispelt something into the google search box.. <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Browser">MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Browser</a>. So I click on it. Now, I don&#39;t know much C++, which this web browser was written in but I thought I would give it a try so I forked it, opened it up in Visual Studio 2022 and realised....</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wait.. This is a Visual Studio 2019 Project</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I decided to port it to Visual Studio 2022 because I couldn&#39;t be bothered to re-download Visual Studio as a different version. After about an hour of porting, I had finally fully ported it to 2022, now I can start working on it.</p>
<h2>Actually Coding It</h2>
<p>After Inspecting the code for a while, whilst I am not a C++ expert, I discovered most of it was configurable extremely easily; In fact the UI was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript! So I edited the code, mainly the CSS to make it look better but also a bit of JavaScript then I came out with this....</p>
